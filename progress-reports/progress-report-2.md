# Progress Report 2

1. Literature Review: What background materials have you read for your project? What materials do you plan to read for your project? Have you been able to build upon previous research in your field? How is your project different and why? Can you clearly articulate how your project advances research in your field?

Most of my literary research has been related to reading scholarly articles on optimal traversals of graphs. This is because the majority of my thesis is fundamentally based on an optimal but unique traversal of a graph, namely exercises, topics and chapters.

The technology I have been using for the visuals is called React. As part of the underlying technology they have a graph traversal implemented for comparing two different graphs for the purpose of identify changes and updates between the two.

This has led me to other related scholarly articles relating to graph traversals.

2. Is there any other reading that you still need to analyze for future directions in your research? How is previous research informing progress on your current project?

The current paper I am reading titled "A survey on Tree Edit Distance and Related Problems" has been labeled by some as the "state of the art algorithm" on generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree/graph into another one.

3. Please list the concrete steps you plan to pursue between now and the third installment submission deadline on March 4, 2019. If you are a Scholars Team, describe your individual contributions.

Currently a basic implementation of moving one chapter around is place. Below are the remaining tasks to

- Fully integrate topics
- update order generally (for all chapters/exercises) based on topics
- Integrate a suggestion system based on misplaced dependency orderings
- Optimize the diffing algorithm based on knowledge and algorithms learned from my readings
- Integrate customization to the export of the updated structure of the textbook

4. Are you receiving feedback from your faculty advisor on the content of your thesis? When is your next meeting?

For this semester we are meeting weekly on Mondays at 10:30 AM

5. What do you need to do to be ready for a public presentation in February or March? Can you accomplish this with your current plans? Do you plan to present at LAUNCH URS Symposium? If not, why? Remember, the Presentation Report deadline is April 1, 2019. Do you plan to attend the Presentation Practice Session? Note: If using the Creative Works template, your public presentation and Q&A must be completed before you can write your reflection. Your reflection must be completed and reviewed by your faculty advisor prior to the final thesis deadline. Plan accordingly.

I have already presented at the Joint Math Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland on January 16th.
