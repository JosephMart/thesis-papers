Firstly, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to Dr. Yasskin, without his time and effort he has invested in me, this would not of been possible.

To Akash Rao for important modification to the build process and templates of the textbook allowed for the thesis to be better integrated.

To Alexander Shung and Siyuan Yang for manually converting the existing hierarchy into a far more usable one.
