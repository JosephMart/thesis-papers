\indent After a textbook has been written and published, one may want to customize it for a particular audience; it may be desirable to delete or reorder some of the chapters or sections. However, there may be dependencies among the chapters, sections, examples and exercises which make it very tedious to rearrange the order of not only the chapters but also, the associated exercises. Martinsen is building a graph database to describe the dependencies among the chapters and sections in a portion of the online Calculus book, MYMathApps Calculus, being written by Yasskin. In addition there will be a database of examples and exercises which describes their dependencies on the chapters and sections. Further, he is building a GUI for an instructor or institution to reorder the chapters and sections by drag and drop and have the examples and exercises automatically reorder.
